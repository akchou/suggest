Your mission is to write a keyword suggestion system (as you may have seen
on a search engine page as you type your query). You're only writing the
server-side component whose input is a (partial) query and outputs suggestions. 

You must:

* Make SuggestTest pass.
* Explain your implementation of Suggestor: algorithms, pros/cons of your choices.
* Hypothesize how to your solution would work "in the real world" with real traffic.
